9.Let us pretend the speed of a spriteBee is 200 pixels per second. Calculate the amount of time the
Bee will take to cross the entire width of the screen that is, 2000 pixels wide. Also calculate the bit
rate per second (i.e. bps) of the spriteBee, if 1 pixel contains 8 bits

Answer>>
Time to Cross the Screen:
  Screen width: 2000 pixels
  Speed: 200 pixels/second
  Time 𝑇  = Screen Width/Speed
  𝑇 = 2000 / 200 = 10 seconds

Bit Rate per Second:
1 pixel contains 8 bits.
Speed: 200 pixels/second
Bit rate bps = Pixels per second × Bits per pixel
bps = 200 × 8 = 1600bps
